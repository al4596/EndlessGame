We are doing an endless runner with random obstacles such as bottomless pits and flying enemies. 
The goal of the game is to keep running right and collect coins to earn points over time. 
There will be a counter displayed on screen with the player coin count. 
As the game goes on it progressively gets faster. 
If the player doesn't collect coins and their points go below 0, they automatically lose. 
Basically, a scrolling platformer. We are using unity.
